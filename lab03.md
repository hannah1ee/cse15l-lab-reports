# Lab Report 03 | Bugs and Commands

## Part 1 | Bugs


### Choose one of the bugs from week 4's lab.
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```
### 1. A failure-inducing input for the buggy program

```
@Test
public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 }, input1);
}
```



An input that doesn't induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue.
