- the working directory was ~/lecture1/messages
- There is no output because the command is internal, and so is parsed and executed completely by it's own process. Although there is no output given by the command itself, I can see that I am now returned to my home directory in my next line.

- the working directory was ~
- i got that output because the command cd lecture1 moved me from the home directory to the lecture1 directory.
- this output is not an error.
