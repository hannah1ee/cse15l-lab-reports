**EdStem Post:** Word Counter Program Not Working

Hi! I tried to implement the Java program ```WordCounter.java``` that's supposed to process a string and output how many words are in it. However, I'm encountering ann unexpected behavior when I run my program with certain strings. For some reason, the program doesn't run as expected when the input text contains characters other than spaces. I think the issue might be related to how I'm splitting the text into words.

Here is a screenshot showing the output of my test file when I try to run my program with strings containing characters other than strings:

I've also attached my ```WordCounter.java``` file for reference:

Thank you for your help!
